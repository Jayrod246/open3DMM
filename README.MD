# Official Source Code
[Original source code to the Microsoft 3D Movie Maker project](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker) has now been released
under the [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker/blob/main/LICENSE) as open source.

# Open 3D Movie Maker

This was the latest snapshot of the open source reimplementation of Microsoft 3D Movie Maker (3DMM) in .Net/C# before the original 3DMM was officially open sourced.

The code is hard to navigate, and I wouldn't advise trying to do so. But hopefully someone can get it to build successfully and maybe play around with it.


Now that the source code is available, I can finish up all the loose ends I left behind, and a complete rewrite will begin soon enough. 👍
